# AGM
An arithmetic–geometric sequence is the result of the term-by-term multiplication of a geometric progression with the corresponding terms of an arithmetic progression. 
We have chosen the range 2-14, we’ll calculate the agm for every pair in this range i.e. we graphically represent the AGM graph of each pair as shown in the code.
We have also shown the convergence graph and tried to optimise the code by reducing error to 0.01%
