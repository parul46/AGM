# AGM
An arithmeticâ€“geometric sequence is the result of the term-by-term multiplication of a geometric progression with the corresponding terms of an arithmetic progression. 
Here, we are calculating the AGM for 2 numbers and for a given range of numbers, for every pair we'll calculate their AGM and plot it as shown in the code.
We have also shown the convergence graph and tried to optimise the code by reducing error to 0.01%
